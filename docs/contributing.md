## How do I file a bug report

Navigate to the [Vipyr/taskobra issues](https://github.com/Vipyr/taskobra/issues)
page and click the "New Issue" button.  Select the "Bug report" issue
template and fill in the title and body.

## How do I find something to work on

If you're looking for something to help out with, and you're new to the
project, head over the [Good First Issues](https://github.com/Vipyr/taskobra/labels/good%20first%20issue)
list and take a look around.  Don't see anything interesting, or want a
bigger challenge?  Look no further than the [All Issues](https://github.com/Vipyr/taskobra/issues)
list to find even more.
